# IBM HR Attrition Analysis
A **descriptive analytics** project using the **IBM HR Employee Attrition dataset**. 
Examines key HR metrics and employee characteristics to identify trends related to employee attrition.

## IBM HR Analytics: Descriptive Analysis

This project presents a descriptive analysis of the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. The goal is to explore key patterns, trends, and relationships within the data that may contribute to employee attrition.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Records:** 1470 employees
- **Features:** Attrition, Job Involvement, Job Role, Job Satisfaction, Number of Companies Worked, Over Time, Work Life Balance, Years At Company, Years In Current Role, etc.

## Objectives

- Explore and summarize key features of the dataset
- Visualize distributions and relationships (e.g., attrition vs. job satisfaction, overtime)
- Highlight interesting trends using plots and statistical summaries

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel

## Defining Business Problem

## Data Cleaning

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Tenure in Current Role vs. Attrition: The same pattern holds true for time in a specific role. Employees who attrited had a shorter median time in their current role (2 years) compared to those who stayed (3 years). <br>

Career Stability vs. Attrition: A calculated metric, "Average Working Years Per Company," reveals that employees with a history of longer stays at previous companies are more likely to stay. The median for attrited employees is 2.1 years, while it's 5.0 years for those who did not attrit. This indicates that a history of "job hopping" is associated with a higher risk of attrition. <br>

Job Satisfaction: There is a clear link between job satisfaction and attrition. As job satisfaction increases from "Low" to "Very High," the attrition rate consistently decreases from 23% down to 11%. This shows that satisfied employees are significantly less likely to leave.<br>

<img width="532" height="292" alt="Attrition vs Work Life Balance" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f851bb5c-a7b9-4df6-8ce4-a6d798c5c0e6" /> <br>

Work-Life Balance: Poor work-life balance is a major driver of attrition. The attrition rate for employees with a "Bad" rating is 31%. While better ratings generally decrease attrition, the lowest rate (14%) is observed for a "Good" rating (Level 3), and it slightly rises to 18% for the "Best" rating (Level 4). This suggests that a poor work-life balance is a major red flag, but a perfect balance isn't necessarily the single key to retention. <br>

Environment Satisfaction: Similar to other satisfaction metrics, a poor work environment is a major risk. Employees with a "Low" rating have an attrition rate of 25%. The rate drops sharply to 15% for moderate satisfaction and continues to decrease slightly to 13% for very high satisfaction. This highlights that while a pleasant environment helps, a very negative one is particularly detrimental to retention. <br>
